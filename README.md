# What is this?
ETH-Price Analyzer is currently an Ethereum price logger. By running
stat_logger.py, every 30 seconds Ethereum prices from 9 exchanges will be
written to a csv file. That's all this is for now, but we are constantly
improving it!

# That's nice, How do I run this?
Firstly, run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
Next, run "python stat_logger.py"
And that's it!
